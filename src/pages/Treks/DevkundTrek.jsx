                    Visiting hidden paradises is a luxury best reserved for days when the world feels out of sync. The <strong>Devkund Waterfall</strong>, located near Bhira Dam in Maharashtra, is one such place — a mystical waterfall known as the <strong>"Bathing Pond of Gods"</strong>, with great mythological significance and sacred reverence among the local villagers.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    Devkund waterfall trek is <strong>175 km from Mumbai</strong>, <strong>115 km from Pune</strong>, and <strong>90 km from Lonavala</strong>. Bhira, Patnus village in Raigad district, serves as the base village. The trek is best enjoyed during the rainy season and winter months (June to February), and remains closed during summer due to scorching heat and dry waterfall conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    The Falls — an amalgamation of three waterfalls — are regularly voted as one of the best jungle waterfall treks in India. You can dip your tired feet in the relaxing turquoise waters, enjoy the natural fish spa, and completely rejuvenate. The plunge waterfall changes colour depending on the time of day, creating a magical and picture-perfect scene.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="td-subsection-title">🌊 The Plunge Waterfall</h3>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    During the rainy season, the Devkund plunge waterfall — the origin of the Kundalika River — is fed by the Tamhini Ghat and flows at full force. The waterfall drops 250 feet into a pristine turquoise pool, offering a natural therapy session unlike any other. Be ready with waterproof cameras to capture the monsoon magic.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="td-subsection-title">⚠️ Safety Advisory</h3>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    Devkund waterfall trek is <strong>6 km one way</strong>. Trekkers with reasonable fitness levels should join. Please wear proper trekking shoes as the route is slippery. <strong>Swimming is not allowed</strong> in the Dam or Waterfall. During stream crossings, follow the trek leader's instructions strictly. Trekkers are not allowed to go out of sight of trek guides at any time.

                  <p className="td-para">
                    The <strong>best time to visit Devkund</strong> is during the rainy season and post-monsoon season — <strong>June to February</strong>. During this period, the waterfall flows at its most spectacular, the jungle is lush green, and the turquoise plunge pool is at its deepest. The trail is closed in summer (March–May) due to low water levels and extreme heat.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    Devkund is a "plunge" waterfall that empties massive volumes of water onto the rocky surface below. The magical colour-changing water — from turquoise to deep blue to milky white — makes it a popular spot for one-day picnics and photography.
