const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Are trekking shoes compulsory for Harihar Fort?",
    a: "Yes. The rock-cut steps can be extremely slippery during monsoon and post-rainy season. Campus or Action brand trekking shoes are the first choice for Nashik fort trekkers — they offer the best grip on Sahyadri rock. Sandals and sports shoes are strictly not allowed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best time to visit Harihar Fort?",
    a: "June to February is the best time. During monsoon weekends, the trek is regularly banned due to dangerous overcrowding. Weekday treks in monsoon and winter (November–February) offer the safest, most scenic experience.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is camping allowed at Harihar Fort?",
    a: "No. The forest department prohibits camping due to wildlife in the area, including frequent leopard sightings. You can camp at Igatpuri, Vaitarna, or Nashik and proceed for the fort trek in the morning.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Harihar Fort Nashik's weather like?",
    a: "Summers are sweltering and humid — avoid trekking in summer. Monsoon brings heavy rainfall in the Trimbakeshwar region with fog and low visibility but great scenery. Winter (November–February) is pleasant till late morning — ideal for comfortable trekking. Night treks are recommended in summer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Nashik to Harihar Fort distance?",
    a: "Nashik to Harihar Fort (Harshewadi trailhead) is approximately 42 km — about 1 hour 15 minutes. Harihar Fort to Trimbakeshwar is 13 km. Brahmagiri Parvat can be combined with this trek.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is Harihar Fort banned during monsoon?",
    a: "Multiple accidents during monsoon weekends due to overcrowding prompted bans by the forest department and collector's office. Thousands of tourists on the narrow 117-step staircase simultaneously creates a hazardous situation. Trekkers have been stuck for up to 6 hours. Authorities are planning to introduce daily permits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where is Harihar Fort located in Maharashtra?",
    a: "Harihar Fort (also called Harshagad or Harihargad) is in Maharashtra's Nashik district — 40 km from Nashik city, 48 km from Igatpuri, 13 km from Trimbakeshwar, and 40 km from Ghoti. It was built to watch over the Gonda Ghat commerce route.",
  },
  {
    q: "How to register for the Harihar Fort Trek from Mumbai?",
    a: "Mumbai to Harihar Fort (Nirgudpada) is approximately 190 km — about 5 hours. You can click 'Book Now' to register. The Kasara train route (₹1,099) is most popular from Mumbai. After booking, GPS location and WhatsApp group details are shared.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which is the nearest railway station to Harihar Fort?",
    a: "Kasara Railway Station is the most convenient — approximately 60 km from Harihar Fort base village. From CSMT, take the slow local train to Kasara (2.5 hrs). From Kasara, shared jeeps take you to the trailhead. Pro Tip: If arriving at Kasara past 10 pm, pre-book your jeep taxi.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Harihar Fort and Harihareshwar the same?",
    a: "No. Harihar Fort is a hill fort near Nashik famous for its rock-cut steps. Harihareshwar is a separate coastal tourist destination near Dapoli and Shirvardhan — known for temples and beaches, not a hill fort.",
  },
  {
    q: "How to reach Kalyan to Nashik for the trek?",
    a: "Kalyan to Nashik is approximately 140 km (3 hours). Take a train to Kasara Railway Station on the Central Railway and board a sharing taxi. Taxis charge under ₹100 per person. You can also pre-book a local taxi to drop and pick you up at the trailhead.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Nashik to Ramshej Fort distance?",
    a: "Ramshej Killa is approximately 16 km from Nashik city — about 45 minutes by road. It can be combined with a Nashik area trekking itinerary.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Harihar Fort the most dangerous fort in Maharashtra?",
    a: "The fort itself has well-maintained rock-cut holds and sufficient passage space for safe navigation. However, extreme weekend overcrowding — especially in monsoon — has earned it a dangerous reputation. The steps are safe if climbed with proper footwear and caution on weekdays.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Anjaneri Reverse Waterfall?",
    a: "On the back side of Anjneri Hill is a stunning reverse waterfall — water flies 30 feet above you from the top of the slope during the rains. It is a sacred location (birthplace of Lord Hanuman) and great for early trekkers. Note: Only mobile cameras allowed — professional cameras are prohibited as the fort has endangered endemic wildflowers.",

                  <p className="td-para">
                    Harihar Fort appears rectangular from its base village, but is built on a <strong>triangular prism of rock</strong>. Its three faces and two edges are vertical at 90 degrees, while the third edge towards the west is inclined at a dramatic <strong>75 degrees</strong>. A one-metre wide rocky staircase with hand-carved niches is chiselled directly into the rock face for ascending and descending the fort.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    There are <strong>117 steps</strong> in all. After climbing the first rocky staircase main entrance, you walk below an overhang with a sheer drop. You then climb a set of steep stairs with niches, pass through a staircase inside the rock — similar to Peth Fort or Kothaligad Fort — and finally reach the summit. The view from the top is extraordinary.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    The fort plateau is tapering with a raised level in the middle. A small temple of <strong>Lord Hanuman and Lord Shiva</strong> stands on the plateau, with a natural pond in front providing drinking water. A historic palace with two rooms capable of sheltering 10–12 persons lies further on.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="td-subsection-title">🏛 Harihar Fort History</h3>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    Harihar Fort was built during the Yadava dynasty upon a triangular mountain with nearly vertical elevations. It served as a strategic watchtower over the <strong>Gonda Ghat commerce route</strong>. In 1818, British officer Briggs captured the fort. While the British used cannons to destroy defences and access roads across Maharashtra's forts, Officer Briggs was so astounded by the splendour of Harihar's rock-cut steps that he <strong>left the fort completely intact</strong> — one of the few forts spared by the British.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="td-subsection-title">🦁 Scottish Kada — 170m Vertical Cliff</h3>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    One of the vertical drops facing Nirgudpada village is called the <strong>'Scottish Kada'</strong> — named because it was first climbed in November 1986 by <strong>Doug Scott</strong>, the legendary Himalayan mountaineer, taking him two full days to complete the 170-metre ascent.

                  <h3 className="td-subsection-title">🧗 The Most Challenging Segments</h3>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    The iconic rock-cut steps are the most challenging section. During monsoon, both staircases before and after the Mahadarvaja can be extremely slick. Always maintain <strong>three-point contact</strong> and face the mountain while descending. There is also a narrow traverse — stay to your right as the left side is exposed. If you're afraid of heights, keep your gaze forward while climbing: looking back is terrifying but the panorama is stunning!
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="td-subsection-title">⚠️ Overcrowding Advisory</h3>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    Harihar Fort is <strong>banned on rainy-season weekends</strong> due to dangerous overcrowding. Thousands of tourists on the narrow 117-step staircase simultaneously have caused trekkers to be stuck for up to six hours. <strong>Weekday treks are strongly recommended</strong> — crowd numbers drop by 95%. Authorities are planning to introduce daily permits.

                  <p className="td-para">The Harihar Fort trek route has two stages:</p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    <strong>Stage 1:</strong> From base village Nirgudpada, the trek starts passing through Kotamwadi village. It takes approximately 1 hour 20 minutes to reach the plateau. While climbing, the fort will be on your right-hand side.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    <strong>Stage 2:</strong> From the plateau, hike towards the iconic steps and climb to the summit. This section takes up to 2 hours depending on your skills, crowd, weather, and endurance. The second trailhead at Harshewadi village connects to the same plateau and shares the same route from there.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    From the summit, on a clear day you can see: Bhaskargad/Basgad, Anjaneri Fort, Brahmagiri Hill, Bhandardurg, Vaitarna Lake, Utwad Fort, and many other forts near Nashik.

                  <h2 className="td-section-title">Best Season for Harihar Fort Trek</h2>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    The best time to visit is <strong>May end to February</strong>. Monsoon (June–September) brings spectacular fog-covered Sahyadri scenery — rice fields brilliantly verdant, forts peeking above clouds — but weekend treks are banned due to overcrowding. Weekday monsoon treks are still possible.
                  </p>
                  <p className="td-para">
                    <strong>Winter (November–February)</strong> is safest — fewer trekkers, clear skies for stargazing, fantastic views of surrounding peaks and forts. <strong>Summer night treks</strong> are recommended as daytime is hot and humid with risk of forest fires.
