                Maharashtra is blessed with a 720 km long coastline shared with Konkan, Thane, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. In 2000-01, it was found that the Olive Ridley turtle is a prominent visitor to Maharashtra's shores for breeding. Other species include the Green Turtle, Hawksbill and Leatherback.

                Velas is a small fishing village on the western coast of Maharashtra, about 220 km from Mumbai. It is that time of the year when a tiny grey head pokes out of the golden sand and takes a breath of the fresh salty air of the Arabian Sea.

                This journey starts when the mother emerges from rolling waves to lay 100–120 eggs on the sandy beach under cover of darkness. The tiny hatchlings crawl their way towards the brightest lights on the horizon — the sea. Gadvede Trekkers invites you to witness this miracle of Nature.
              </p>
              <p style={{ color: "#374151", lineHeight: 1.8, fontSize: "0.92rem" }}>
                Olive Ridley turtle conservation trends have spread to nearby villages that have started similar Kasav Mahotsav. Best time to visit is <strong>February to April</strong> to see baby turtles being released at Velas beach.
