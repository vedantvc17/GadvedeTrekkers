        heading: "🧠 Leader Mindset",
        content: `Being a trek leader is a responsibility, not a title. The following mindset principles separate great leaders from average ones:

DECISION-MAKING UNDER PRESSURE:
• Slow down to speed up — in emergencies, breathe and assess before acting
• The group looks to you for calm — panic is contagious; so is composure
• When in doubt, the safest option is ALWAYS the right option
• Never let peer pressure or itinerary pressure override safety judgment

RESPONSIBILITY & AUTHORITY:
• You have the authority to turn back at any point — exercise it without hesitation
• You are responsible for every person from departure to return
• Never delegate safety decisions to participants, no matter their experience level
• Brief, clear, and repeated communication prevents 80% of incidents

HUMILITY & LEARNING:
• Admit what you don't know — guessing in the field costs lives
• Learn the route before leading it — recce walks are not optional
• Debrief after every trek: what went right, what could improve
• Listen to your sweep — they see the group from behind and notice who struggles

PEOPLE SKILLS:
• Know your group before departure — fitness level, fears, medical conditions
• Observe non-verbal cues: a quiet person may be struggling more than a complaining one
• Never embarrass a trekker in front of the group
• Celebrate small wins — a tough section completed deserves acknowledgement

LEADER'S MANTRA:
"Safety first. Summit second. Group always."`,
      },
      {
        heading: "❌ What NOT To Do",
        content: `BEFORE THE TREK — NEVER:
✗ Start a trek without checking weather in the last 12 hours
✗ Accept participants without knowing their fitness level
✗ Skip the route briefing — even if the group has done the trek before
✗ Assume someone else is tracking headcount
✗ Share confidential participant data on public WhatsApp groups

DURING THE TREK — NEVER:
✗ Allow any trekker to go ahead of the leader
✗ Cross a flowing stream above knee height
✗ Ignore a trekker who says they feel unwell — stop immediately
✗ Let the group split into unsupervised sub-groups
✗ Take selfies or reels at cliff edges — ever
✗ Argue with a participant in front of the group
✗ Continue the trek if you are unsure of the route
✗ Allow trekkers to eat or drink unknown plants/berries
✗ Ignore thunder — the 30-second rule is absolute

IN AN EMERGENCY — NEVER:
✗ Panic visibly — you set the emotional tone
✗ Move a head/spine injury patient without immobilisation
✗ Cut or suck a snake bite
✗ Apply a tourniquet except for arterial bleeding
✗ Leave an injured trekker alone
✗ Continue the trek after a serious incident — the trek is over
✗ Lie to a participant or family member about the severity of a situation`,

• Administer Paracetamol for headache

MODERATE/SEVERE SYMPTOMS: confusion, loss of coordination, breathlessness at rest

SPRAIN:
Apply RICE protocol:
• Rest — stop activity immediately
• Ice — cold water or wet cloth (15–20 min)
• Compression — crepe bandage firmly (not tight)
• Elevation — raise the limb above heart level

        content: `FIGURE-8 FOLLOW-THROUGH (Stopper Knot)
• Use: Attaching rope to harness or anchor; most secure end knot
• Steps: Form a figure-8 loop → pass the tail through the harness → retrace the 8 exactly
• Load bearing: Yes — rated for body weight
• Check: Both strands run parallel with no crossings

BOWLINE (Fixed Loop Knot)
• Use: Rescue loops, attaching rope to fixed points, life-saving in emergency
• Steps: Form a small loop → rabbit comes up through the hole → goes around the tree → back down the hole
• Strength: ~75% of rope tensile strength
• Remember: "Rabbit up the hole, around the tree, back down the hole"

CLOVE HITCH (Quick Adjustable Knot)
• Use: Tying rope to trees, poles, anchors quickly
• Steps: Two half-hitches around a pole
• Advantage: Easily adjustable under load; self-tightening
• Limitation: Can slip if load direction changes frequently

SQUARE (REEF) KNOT (Joining Two Ropes)
• Use: Joining two ropes of equal diameter; bandage tying
• Steps: Right over left → left over right
• WARNING: Not load-bearing for rescue — use double fisherman's knot instead
• Mnemonic: "Right over left, left over right — makes the knot tidy and tight"`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Rope Rescue Techniques",
        content: `SIMPLE LOWER (Lowering an injured trekker):
1. Anchor rope securely to a tree or rock (double anchor preferred)
2. Tie Figure-8 loop around trekker's chest/harness
3. Create friction: wrap rope 3× around tree or use carabiner
4. Lower slowly with one person controlling rope tension
5. Rescuer spotting from below guides the patient

IMPROVISED HARNESS (when no harness available):
• Use 3–4 m of rope
• Create a loop around waist and two leg loops
• Connect all loops at the front with a separate rope and carabiner
• Never use this for falls — only for controlled lowering

HAULING SYSTEM (extracting someone from a gorge/hole):
• Use a 3:1 Z-pulley system
• Requires: 2 carabiners, 1 pulley or smooth rope pass
• Three people pulling = lifts weight equal to one person

SAFETY RULES:
• Never use rope older than 5 years for rescue
• Inspect rope before every trek: check for cuts, fraying, stiffness
• Retire rope after any shock load (fall)`,

• Natural windbreak (boulders, tree line) on windward side
• At least 60 m from water sources (rivers, streams, lakes)
• Away from animal tracks and dry streambeds
• Protected from direct lightning exposure (avoid hilltops, lone trees)

❌ AVOID:
• Dry riverbeds (flash flood risk)
• Hilltops and ridges (lightning, wind exposure)

2. Unpack and lay inner tent flat — check orientation (door away from prevailing wind)
3. Assemble poles — slot into sleeves or clips without forcing
4. Raise the tent — lift from centre, insert pole ends into grommets
5. Stake out — drive pegs at 45° outward angle, starting from corners
6. Attach fly sheet — ensure it does NOT touch the inner tent
7. Tension guy ropes — taut but not so tight they pull pegs
8. Check: ground sheet tucked under tent (not poking out to channel water in)

INTERIOR SETUP:
• Sleeping bags: foot toward door (easy exit in emergency)
• Wet gear: in porch/vestibule, never in sleeping area
• Torch: within arm's reach of sleeping position`,

• Add extra guy ropes — minimum 6 anchor points for dome tent
• Lower the tent profile if possible
• Weight ground-level corners with rocks inside corners of groundsheet
• If wind exceeds 60 km/h: evacuate tent, shelter in rock outcrop or tree line

HEAVY RAIN PROTOCOL:
• Dig a shallow drainage trench (5 cm deep) around tent perimeter
• Ensure fly sheet is fully deployed and tensioned
• Never open tent zips facing the rain — always turn tent opening away from rain direction
• Check guy ropes every 2 hours in sustained rain (ropes shrink when wet, tighten them)
• If pooling begins inside: move to higher ground immediately

MORNING TENT CARE:
• Shake out condensation before packing
• Never pack a wet tent into its bag for more than 12 hours — dry at next opportunity`,

4. Physical anchor: place their hands on a solid surface (ground, rock)
5. Avoid: "calm down", "it's nothing", false promises
6. Do NOT leave them alone — assign one calm trekker as companion

IF PANIC DOES NOT SUBSIDE IN 10 MINUTES:
• Begin assisted descent immediately
• Contact family/emergency contact
• Do not continue with the group trek

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

3. Avoid lone trees, tall trees, metal poles, wire fences

• Cool the body: wet cloth on neck, wrists, head

HEAT EXHAUSTION vs HEAT STROKE:
• Heat exhaustion: heavy sweating, pale skin, cool/clammy — treat as above
• Heat stroke (EMERGENCY): NO sweating, hot/red/dry skin, confusion, loss of consciousness
