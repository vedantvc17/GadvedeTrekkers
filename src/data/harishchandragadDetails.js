  subtitle: "The Most Scenic Route: Harishchandragad Trek and Camping",
  intro: `Harishchandragad is one of the best high forts near Mumbai, Maharashtra. Strong fortifications of this fort have multiple entry routes such as the Junnar gate route, Sadhale ghat, Nalichi wat, and Indore waat. Its ancient rock-cut temples, sacred caves, and the breathtaking Kokankada cliff make it an unforgettable destination in the Sahyadris.`,
  history: `The carvings on the temples of Nageshwar (in Khireshwar village), in the Harishchandreshwar temple and in the cave of Kedareshwar indicate that the fort belongs to the medieval period since it is related to Shaiva, Shakta or Naath. Later the fort was under the control of Mughals. The Marathas captured it in 1747.`,
  mainAttractions: `Main attractions on Fort: Sapta Tirta Pushkarini, Kedareshwar Cave, Konkan Kada (Konkan cliff), Taramati peak, Temple of Harishchandreshwar.`,

export const harishchandragadHistory = `Harishchandragad's history is linked with that of Malshej Ghat, Kothale village, and it has played a major role in guarding and controlling the surrounding region. The fort's rock carvings at Harishchandreshwar temple and the Nageshwar temple in Khireshwar village indicate medieval origins tied to Shaiva, Shakta, and Naath traditions. The Marathas captured it from the Mughals in 1747. Today it forms part of the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary, one of Maharashtra's most biodiverse protected areas. The fort's famous Kedareshwar Cave houses a massive Shiva Linga surrounded by ice-cold waist-deep water — four pillars once surrounded the linga, and locals believe the remaining one represents the Kali Yuga.`;
