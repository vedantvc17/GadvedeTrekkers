  intro: `Kalsubai Peak (1646 m / 5400 ft) is the highest peak in Maharashtra, nestled in the Sahyadri range inside the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary. Steel railings, chains, and ladders at difficult sections make this trek accessible for beginners and thrilling for veterans alike.`,
  nightTrek: `Embark on an unforgettable night trek to Mount Kalsubai — experience the magic of walking under a blanket of millions of stars, guided by the soft glow of moonlight and the Milky Way. The trail begins from Bari Village, winding through farmlands, rocky patches, and sturdy ladders. Reaching the summit just before dawn rewards you with one of the most breathtaking sunrises in the Sahyadris. Seek blessings at the Kalsubai Temple dedicated to the local goddess who guards the peak.`,
  monsoon: `During monsoon, the entire mountain is draped in emerald green, covered in mist and fog. Three ladders installed by locals mark the trail milestones — after the carved steps and first ladder you have completed 1/3 of the trek; after the final ladder, 2/3 is done. A plateau walk leads to the summit ladder.`,

export const kalsubaiHistory = `Kalsubai is named after a local woman named Kalsu who is believed to have lived on the peak and the goddess Kalsubai who is worshipped at the small temple at the summit. Legends say Kalsu was a devoted woman whose spirit guards the mountain. The peak lies within the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary, one of Maharashtra's most biodiverse protected areas. The fort-like peak has historically served as a strategic vantage point offering panoramic views of Bhandardara Dam, Arthur Lake, and the surrounding Sahyadri ranges.`;
